- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on distributed systems
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about system design & data-intensive applications & AWS
- :dancers: Iâ€™m looking for collaboration on building open source projects that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable.

- :deciduous_tree: I've navigated my company towards a cloud transformation in early 2020 -- closed the data centers, built out a modern SaaS development environment, got cloud native with foundational building blocks like containers and Kubernetes, and continued transforming into an AI-driven organization that make our customers' lives easier. 
- :tiger: I think that an engineering org should focus on shipping products and features faster, not making individaul devs more productive.
