##  🕸️ Rules of Thumb for Computer Architecture - A Quantitative Approach
1. Amdahl/Case Rule: A balanced computer system needs about 1 MB of main memory capacity and 1 megabit per second of I/O bandwidth per MIPS of CPU performance.

2. 90/10 Locality Rule: A program executes about 90% of its instructions in 10% of its code.

3. Bandwidth Rule: Bandwidth grows by at least the square of the improvement in latency.

4. 2:1 Cache Rule: The miss rate of a direct-mapped cache of size N is about the same as a two-way set- associative cache of size N/2.

5. Dependability Rule: Design with no single point of failure.

6. Watt-Year Rule: The fully burdened cost of a Watt per year in a Warehouse Scale Computer in North America in 2011, including the cost of amortizing the power and cooling infrastructure, is about $2.

- 🔭 I’m writing hard core software engineering articles on Medium.
- 🌱 I’m revisiting the fundamentals of computer science by learning Nand2Tetris, Redis source code and cyber security in Kali Linux.
- 💬 Ask me about software architecure, system design & data-intensive applications & AWS.

- :tiger: I think that an engineering org should focus on shipping products and features faster, not making individaul devs more productive.
- ⚡ I also believe that if I have to fail at something, I would fail fast and work out a new approach to solve it.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The Apollo 11 mission computer required only 4KB of ram. (2048 words to be exact. [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer))

- :deciduous_tree: I've navigated my company towards a cloud transformation in early 2020 -- closed the data centers, built out a modern SaaS development environment, got cloud native with foundational building blocks like containers and Kubernetes, and continued transforming into an AI-driven organization that make our customers' lives easier. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
- 💬 Ask me about ...
- 📫 How to reach me: ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
- :dancers: I’m looking for collaboration on building open source projects that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable.
- 🦅 I'm comfortable with Python & JavaScript for data structure and algorithms and Golang for backend development.
- 😜 I can build complex React apps but I am more passionate for backend engineering.
- 👯 I have mananged an engineering org of 6 people, and I think the only way to stay sharp in engineering is personally getting hands dirty now and then.
